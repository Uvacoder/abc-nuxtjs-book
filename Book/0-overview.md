# Overview

We're going to create an application called NuxtStrap. We'll be using
[BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/) as our custom UI framework which
is a Vue version of Bootstrap.

We will start by generating a new Nuxt project.
Once it's setup, we'll start working through the process as if it was truly a new and real
project. Through this process we'll be learning Nuxt.js concepts.

Let's get started!
