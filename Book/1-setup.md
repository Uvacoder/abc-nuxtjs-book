title: 1. Setup

# Project Setup

Our application will be called NuxtStrap, and we'll be using [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/) as our custom UI framework which is a Vue version of Bootstrap.

From the root of the `nuxt-quickstart` directory we'll create our newest application by following the same steps as before:

From the `nuxt-quickstart` directory:

## Create the application

```bash
yarn create nuxt-app nuxtstrap
# Or With npx
npx create-nuxt-app nuxtstrap
```

1. This will run you through a set of options and choose accordingly so your result is as follows:

2. Once completed, `cd` into `nuxtstrap` and open it in your editor of choice.

```bash
cd nuxtstrap
```

## Running Our Dev Environment

1. Inside the `nuxtstrap` directory, we can run our development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

1. View the result at localhost:3000. It should look similar to the following:

Now we're ready to begin building our application, and will be using NuxtStrap for the remainder of Chapter 2 to do so.
