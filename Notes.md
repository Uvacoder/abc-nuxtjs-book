# Notes

## VSCode

- Use Stylus Supreme for getting formatting of `.styl` files to work

## VuePress

- Added the following for getting updates to that vPressNavinator utility:
  ```js
  {
    extraWatchFiles: [require.resolve(vpressNavigatorPath)];
  }
  ```

## Stylus

- You can do glob importing
- Imports are doing via `@import`
