### Why Did I Build This?

During my many hours of Nuxt.js development, there were several situations where I spent
a good amount of time figuring out an optimal way of handling a use case or how to
make something work.

I would then forget the specifics when needing to recall this information in a
future project.

The goal of Nuxt Guide is to fill that need by being a collection of notes and snippets which
allows one to quickly copy a snippet or refresh his or her memory without needing to
hunt through past projects.
