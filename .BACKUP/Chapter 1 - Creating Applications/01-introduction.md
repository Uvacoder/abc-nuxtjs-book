# Chapter 1: Creating Nuxt.js Applications

We will first create two Nuxt projects using their CLI tool. This will demonstrate how quick and easy it is to get started with customized Nuxt.js applications.

Following these first two apps, we will create a third project, which we'll use to begin learning the basics of developing and customizing Nuxt.js applications.

**_There are two important items to note before continuing:_**

1. For version 1.0 and higher of Nuxt.js, you will need at least version 8.0.0 of Node. Check your node version by running:

```bash
node -v
```

1. If you do not have `yarn` installed or do wish to use it, use can use `npm` instead. For example:

```bash
# Instead of:
yarn dev

# Use this:
npm run dev
```
